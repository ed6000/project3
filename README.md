# Project 3: PlanIt!

## Introduction

PlanIt is a new innovative technology which brings peak efficiency making time constraints a thing of the past! It is intended for busy individuals who want to be able to maximize their time. We are also using three external APIs: Yelp, GoodReads, and TicketMaster. This allows users to be able to add restaurants, movies, and books to their schedule. Technologies used to build this app: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and React. We are also using the following npm packages: axios, moment, react-router-dom, react-big-calendar.
